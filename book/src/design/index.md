# Design

The Wallet SDK is a pretty complex project with a lot of moving pieces. Therefore, the purpose of this section is to try to break down how it's designed, to make it easier to understand how to use and contribute to the project.

Nothing here is set in stone, so if you have a better idea, feel free to suggest it on GitHub issues or make a pull request. We welcome contributions!
